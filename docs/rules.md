# 📜 Development Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Git Policy 🛑
- **Commit & Push**: Do **NOT** verify or push unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive messages (e.g., "Fix bonfire removal bug" instead of "update").

## 2. Code Quality 🧹
- **Syntax Check**: After modifying any `*.js` file, **ALWAYS** check for syntax errors before running.
- **File Integrity**: Ensure no critical functions (like `showFloatingNote`) are accidentally deleted during refactors.

## 3. Communication 🗣️
- **Language**: Respond in Korean (Project Default).
- **Proactive Checks**: If a user request is vague, ask for clarification before implementing complex features.
